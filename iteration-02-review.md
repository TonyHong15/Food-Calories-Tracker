# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 23rd November 2020
 * Where: Online voice call over Discord

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
 - The members working on the frontend spent large amounts of time working on features at the same while communicating over a voice call. This proved to be an effective strategy as it allowed the members to quickly plan out views without having work overlap.
 
 - Given the time constraints our team was dealt with, the team did a great job at defining a realistic scope for deliverable 2. Although we would have loved to develop a project with countless features, one of the big goals of the course is to create a working application. Rather than overpromising on our work, we knew our limits and aimed for features that we could implement successfully and in a timely fashion

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- Our team's plan to work on a partner project was cancelled after complications arose in the planning process with the partners and course faculty. Since this change was made late in the semester, it affected the time constraints for our current project. We feel that we should've met with the partner company more often. This way any conflicts would have arose earlier and allowed us to progress with the project at a faster rate.

- As we found ourselves short on time, our team felt the pressure to push out features as quickly as possible. There were a few times when members of the team were out of synch with the content of each other's work. Once again, more communication could have helped here. Although we were short on time, it would have been helpful to squeeze in extra team meetings to have everyone be on the same page at all times.

#### Q3. Planned changes

- With the start of any web application, a large of amount of frontend functionality is required to be implemented. As we move forward with the rest of the features, we predict that more work will be need to be done on the backend. For this reason we will make sure to have some of the team members reorganize roles from time to time to stay on track with our timelines.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 
 As we are no longer with a partner company anymore we do not have a project demo at the moment. You can expect to hear the details of our project demo in the future in deliverable 3.
