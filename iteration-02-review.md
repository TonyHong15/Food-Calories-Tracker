 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- The members working on the frontend spent large amounts of time working on features at the same while communicating over a voice call. This proved to be an effective strategy as it allowed the members to quickly plan out views without having work overlap.

#### Q3. Planned changes

- With the start of any web application, a large of amount of frontend functionality is required to be implemented. As we move forward with the rest of the features, we predict that more work will be need to be done on the backend. For this reason we will make sure to have some of the team members reorganize roles from time to time to stay on track with our timelines.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
